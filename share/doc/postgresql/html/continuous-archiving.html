>   At all times, <SPAN

   <I

   subdirectory of the cluster's data directory. The log describes
   every change made to the database's data files.  This log exists
   primarily for crash-safety purposes: if the system crashes, the
   database can be restored to consistency by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"replaying"</SPAN
> the
   log entries made since the last checkpoint.  However, the existence
   of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up
   databases: we can combine a file-system-level backup with backup of
   the WAL files.  If recovery is needed, we restore the backup and
   then replay from the backed-up WAL files to bring the backup up to
   current time.  This approach is more complex to administer than
   either of the previous approaches, but it has some significant
   benefits:
  <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>     We do not need a perfectly consistent backup as the starting point.
     Any internal inconsistency in the backup will be corrected by log
     replay (this is not significantly different from what happens during
     crash recovery).  So we don't need file system snapshot capability,
     just <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tar</SPAN

    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     Since we can string together an indefinitely long sequence of WAL files
     for replay, continuous backup can be achieved simply by continuing to archive
     the WAL files.  This is particularly valuable for large databases, where
     it might not be convenient to take a full backup frequently.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     There is nothing that says we have to replay the WAL entries all the
     way to the end.  We could stop the replay at any point and have a
     consistent snapshot of the database as it was at that time.  Thus,
     this technique supports <I

   Also, it requires a lot of archival storage: the base backup might be bulky,

   have to be archived.  Still, it is the preferred backup technique in
   many situations where high reliability is needed.
  </P

><P
>    In an abstract sense, a running <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    produces an indefinitely long sequence of WAL records.  The system
    physically divides this sequence into WAL <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>segment
    files</I
>, which are normally 16MB apiece (although the segment size
    can be altered when building <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    files are given numeric names that reflect their position in the
    abstract WAL sequence.  When not using WAL archiving, the system
    normally creates just a few segment files and then
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    to higher segment numbers.  It's assumed that a segment file whose
    contents precede the checkpoint-before-last is no longer of
    interest and can be recycled.
   </P
><P
>    When archiving WAL data, we need to capture the contents of each segment
    file once it is filled, and save that data somewhere before the segment
    file is recycled for reuse.  Depending on the application and the
    available hardware, there could be many different ways of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    the data somewhere"</SPAN
>: we could copy the segment files to an NFS-mounted
    directory on another machine, write them onto a tape drive (ensuring that
    you have a way of identifying the original name of each file), or batch
    them together and burn them onto CDs, or something else entirely.  To
    provide the database administrator with as much flexibility as possible,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> tries not to make any assumptions about how
    the archiving will be done.  Instead, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    the administrator specify a shell command to be executed to copy a
    completed segment file to wherever it needs to go.  The command could be
    as simple as a <TT

    script &mdash; it's all up to you.

    and specify the shell command to use in the <A

    Write <TT

    like:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

><P>
    which will copy archivable WAL segments to the directory
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/server/archivedir</TT
>.  (This is an example, not a
    recommendation, and might not work on all platforms.)  After the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%p</TT

    the actual command executed might look like this:

   </P
><P
>    The archive command will be executed under the ownership of the same
    user that the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    the series of WAL files being archived contains effectively everything
    in your database, you will want to be sure that the archived data is
    protected from prying eyes; for example, archive into a directory that
    does not have group or world read access.
   </P
><P
>    It is important that the archive command return zero exit status if and
    only if it succeeded.  Upon getting a zero result,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    successfully archived, and will remove or recycle it.  However, a nonzero
    status tells <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    it will try again periodically until it succeeds.
   </P
><P
>    The archive command should generally be designed to refuse to overwrite
    any pre-existing archive file.  This is an important safety feature to
    preserve the integrity of your archive in case of administrator error
    (such as sending the output of two different servers to the same archive
    directory).
    It is advisable to test your proposed archive command to ensure that it
    indeed does not overwrite an existing file, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>and that it returns
    nonzero status in this case</I
></SPAN
>.  We have found that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cp -i</TT
> does
    this correctly on some platforms but not others.  If the chosen command
    does not itself handle this case correctly, you should add a command
    to test for pre-existence of the archive file.  For example, something
    like:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>archive_command = 'test ! -f .../%f &amp;&amp; cp %p .../%f'</PRE
><P>
    works correctly on most Unix variants.
   </P
><P
>    While designing your archiving setup, consider what will happen if
    the archive command fails repeatedly because some aspect requires
    operator intervention or the archive runs out of space. For example, this
    could occur if you write to tape without an autochanger; when the tape
    fills, nothing further can be archived until the tape is swapped.
    You should ensure that any error condition or request to a human operator
    is reported appropriately so that the situation can be
    resolved reasonably quickly. The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> directory will
    continue to fill with WAL segment files until the situation is resolved.
    (If the filesystem containing <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> fills up,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will do a PANIC shutdown.  No prior
    transactions will be lost, but the database will be unavailable until
    you free some space.)
   </P
><P
>    The speed of the archiving command is not important, so long as it can keep up
    with the average rate at which your server generates WAL data.  Normal
    operation continues even if the archiving process falls a little behind.
    If archiving falls significantly behind, this will increase the amount of
    data that would be lost in the event of a disaster. It will also mean that
    the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> directory will contain large numbers of
    not-yet-archived segment files, which could eventually exceed available
    disk space. You are advised to monitor the archiving process to ensure that
    it is working as you intend.
   </P
><P
>    In writing your archive command, you should assume that the file names to
    be archived can be up to 64 characters long and can contain any
    combination of ASCII letters, digits, and dots.  It is not necessary to
    remember the original relative path (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%p</TT
>) but it is necessary to
    remember the file name (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   </P
><P
>    Note that although WAL archiving will allow you to restore any
    modifications made to the data in your <SPAN

    a limit on how old unarchived data can be, you can set
    <A

    This situation is normal, and not an error, when taking a base backup
    of an active database; so you need to ensure that you can distinguish
    complaints of this sort from real errors.  For example, some versions
    of <SPAN

    <SPAN

    and <TT

    nor between the end of the backup and <CODE

>    To make use of the backup, you will need to keep around all the WAL
    segment files generated during and after the file system backup.
    To aid you in doing this, the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_stop_backup</CODE
> function
    creates a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>backup history file</I
> that is immediately
    stored into the WAL archive area. This file is named after the first
    WAL segment file that you need to have to make use of the backup.
    For example, if the starting WAL file is
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD</TT
> the backup history file will be
    named something like
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD.007C9330.backup</TT
>. (The second
    part of the file name stands for an exact position within the WAL
    file, and can ordinarily be ignored.) Once you have safely archived
    the file system backup and the WAL segment files used during the
    backup (as specified in the backup history file), all archived WAL
    segments with names numerically less are no longer needed to recover
    the file system backup and can be deleted. However, you should
    consider keeping several backup sets to be absolutely certain that
    you can recover your data.

    ID number is part of WAL segment file names, and so a new timeline does
    not overwrite the WAL data generated by previous timelines.  It is
    in fact possible to archive many different timelines.  While that might
    seem like a useless feature, it's often a lifesaver.  Consider the
    situation where you aren't quite sure what point-in-time to recover to,
    and so have to do several point-in-time recoveries by trial and error
    until you find the best place to branch off from the old history.  Without

    archive area just like WAL segment files.  The history files are just
    small text files, so it's cheap and appropriate to keep them around
    indefinitely (unlike the segment files which are large).  You can, if
    you like, add comments to a history file to make your own notes about
    how and why this particular timeline came to be.  Such comments will be
    especially valuable when you have a thicket of different timelines as

      The switch file <TT

      created first, enabling archiving of completed WAL files to occur.
      After the backup the switch file is removed. Archived WAL files are
      then added to the backup so that both base backup and all required
      WAL files are part of the same <SPAN

      Please remember to add error handling to your backup scripts.

      Using a separate script file is advisable any time you want to use
      more than a single command in the archiving process.
      This allows all complexity to be managed within the script, which
      can be written in a popular scripting language such as
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>bash</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>perl</SPAN

      Any messages written to <TT

>stderr</TT

      in the database server log, allowing complex configurations to be
      diagnosed easily if they fail.

     each such index after completing a recovery operation.

     the template database that the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE DATABASE</TT
> copied
     is modified while the base backup is still in progress, it is
     possible that recovery will cause those modifications to be
     propagated into the created database as well.  This is of course
     undesirable.  To avoid this risk, it is best not to modify any
     template databases while taking a base backup.

><P

     commands are WAL-logged with the literal absolute path, and will
     therefore be replayed as tablespace creations with the same
     absolute path.  This might be undesirable if the log is being
     replayed on a different machine.  It can be dangerous even if the
     log is being replayed on the same machine, but into a new data
     directory: the replay will still overwrite the contents of the
     original tablespace.  To avoid potential gotchas of this sort,
     the best practice is to take a new base backup after creating or
     dropping tablespaces.

   </P

>    It should also be noted that the default <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>
    format is fairly bulky since it includes many disk page snapshots.
    These page snapshots are designed to support crash recovery, since
    we might need to fix partially-written disk pages.  Depending on
    your system hardware and software, the risk of partial writes might
    be small enough to ignore, in which case you can significantly
    reduce the total volume of archived logs by turning off page
    snapshots using the <A
HREF="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES"
>full_page_writes</A
>
    parameter.  (Read the notes and warnings in <A
HREF="wal.html"
>Chapter 28</A
>
    before you do so.)  Turning off page snapshots does not prevent
    use of the logs for PITR operations.  An area for future
    development is to compress archived WAL data by removing
    unnecessary page copies even when <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>full_page_writes</TT
> is
    on.  In the meantime, administrators might wish to reduce the number
    of page snapshots included in WAL by increasing the checkpoint
    interval parameters as much as feasible.
