        a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might

        normally stored in WAL will not be enough to completely restore
        such a page during post-crash recovery.  Storing the full page image
        guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at a price
        in increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL.
        (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient
        to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint.
        Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to
        increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)
