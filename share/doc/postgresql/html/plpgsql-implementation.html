    For example, it is a bad idea
    to use a variable name that is the same as any table or column name
    that you need to reference in queries within the function, because
    what you think is a table or column name will still get replaced.
    In the above example, suppose that <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>logtable</TT
> has
    column names <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>logtxt</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>logtime</TT
>,
    and we try to write the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>        INSERT INTO logtable (logtxt, logtime) VALUES (logtxt, curtime);</PRE
><P>
    This will be fed to the main SQL parser as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>        INSERT INTO logtable ($1, logtime) VALUES ($1, $2);</PRE
><P>
    resulting in a syntax error like this:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>ERROR:  syntax error at or near "$1"
LINE 1: INSERT INTO logtable ( $1 , logtime) VALUES ( $1 ,  $2 )
                               ^
QUERY:  INSERT INTO logtable ( $1 , logtime) VALUES ( $1 ,  $2 )
CONTEXT:  SQL statement in PL/PgSQL function "logfunc2" near line 5</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    This example is fairly easy to diagnose, since it leads to an
    obvious syntax error.  Much nastier are cases where the substitution
    is syntactically permissible, since the only symptom may be misbehavior
    of the function.  In one case, a user wrote something like this:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    DECLARE
        val text;
        search_key integer;
    BEGIN
        ...
        FOR val IN SELECT val FROM table WHERE key = search_key LOOP ...</PRE
><P>
    and wondered why all his table entries seemed to be NULL.  Of course
    what happened here was that the query became
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>        SELECT $1 FROM table WHERE key = $2</PRE
><P>
    and thus it was just an expensive way of assigning <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>val</TT
>'s
    current value back to itself for each row.
   </P
><P
>    A commonly used coding rule for avoiding such traps is to use a
    different naming convention for <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
>
    variables than you use for table and column names.  For example,
    if all your variables are named
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>v_<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>something</I
></TT
></TT
> while none of your
    table or column names start with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>v_</TT
>, you're pretty safe.
   </P
><P
>    Another workaround is to use qualified (dotted) names for SQL entities.
    For instance we could safely have written the above example as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>        FOR val IN SELECT table.val FROM table WHERE key = search_key LOOP ...</PRE
><P>
    because <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> will not substitute a
    variable for a trailing component of a qualified name.
    However this solution does not work in every case &mdash; you can't
    qualify a name in an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>'s column name list, for instance.
    Another point is that record and row variable names will be matched to
    the first components of qualified names, so a qualified SQL name is
    still vulnerable in some cases.
    In such cases choosing a non-conflicting variable name is the only way.
   </P
><P
>    Another technique you can use is to attach a label to the block in
    which your variables are declared, and then qualify the variable names
    in your SQL commands (see <A
HREF="plpgsql-structure.html"
>Section 38.2</A
>).
    For example,
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    &lt;&lt;pl&gt;&gt;
    DECLARE
        val text;
    BEGIN
        ...
        UPDATE table SET col = pl.val WHERE ...</PRE
><P>
    This is not in itself a solution to the problem of conflicts,
    since an unqualified name in a SQL command is still at risk of being
    interpreted the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"wrong"</SPAN
> way.  But it is useful for clarifying
    the intent of potentially-ambiguous code.
   </P
><P
>    Variable substitution does not happen in the command string given
    to <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE</TT
> or one of its variants.  If you need to
    insert a varying value into such a command, do so as part of
    constructing the string value, as illustrated in
    <A
HREF="plpgsql-statements.html#PLPGSQL-STATEMENTS-EXECUTING-DYN"
>Section 38.5.4</A
>.
   </P

    because the main SQL engine allows parameter symbols only in these
    commands.  To use a non-constant name or value in other statement
    types (generically called utility statements), you must construct
    the utility statement as a string and <TT

    substantially reduce the total amount of time required to parse
    and generate execution plans for the statements in a
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

    in a specific expression or command cannot be detected until that
    part of the function is reached in execution.  (Trivial syntax
    errors will be detected during the initial parsing pass, but
    anything deeper will not be detected until execution.)

>    Once <SPAN

    can cause some problems if you dynamically
    alter your database schema. For example:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FUNCTION populate() RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    -- declarations
BEGIN
    PERFORM my_function();
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;</PRE
><P>

    If you execute the above function, it will reference the OID for
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>my_function()</CODE
> in the execution plan produced for
    the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>PERFORM</TT
> statement. Later, if you
    drop and recreate <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>populate()</CODE

    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>my_function()</CODE

    start a new database session so that <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>populate()</CODE

    will be compiled afresh, before it will work again. You can avoid
    this problem by using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</TT

    when updating the definition of
    <CODE

    Sometimes this means that a plan is less efficient than it would be
    if generated for a specific variable value.  As an example, consider
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * INTO myrec FROM dictionary WHERE word LIKE search_term;</PRE
><P>
    where <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>search_term</TT
> is a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN

    variable.  The cached plan for this query will never use an index on
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>word</TT
>, since the planner cannot assume that the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LIKE</TT
> pattern will be left-anchored at run time.  To use
    an index the query must be planned with a specific constant
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LIKE</TT
> pattern provided.  This is another situation where
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE</TT
> can be used to force a new plan to be
    generated for each execution.
   </P
><P
>     The mutable nature of record variables presents another problem in this
     connection.  When fields of a record variable are used in
     expressions or statements, the data types of the fields must not
     change from one call of the function to the next, since each
     expression will be planned using the data type that is present
     when the expression is first reached.  <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXECUTE</TT
> can be
     used to get around this problem when necessary.
    </P
><P
>     If the same function is used as a trigger for more than one table,
     <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN

     independently for each such table &mdash; that is, there is a cache
     for each trigger function and table combination, not just for each
     function.  This alleviates some of the problems with varying
     data types; for instance, a trigger function will be able to work
     successfully with a column named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>key</TT
> even if it happens
     to have different types in different tables.
    </P
><P
>     Likewise, functions having polymorphic argument types have a separate
     plan cache for each combination of actual argument types they have been
     invoked for, so that data type differences do not cause unexpected
     failures.
    </P
><P
>    Plan caching can sometimes have surprising effects on the interpretation
    of time-sensitive values.  For example there
    is a difference between what these two functions do:
