    insertion to be committed separately,
    <SPAN

    each row that is added.  An additional benefit of doing all
    insertions in one transaction is that if the insertion of one row

   </P

    for you to do is to:
    <P
></P

><LI
><P
>       Set appropriate (i.e., larger than normal) values for
       <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"

CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</TT
>.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       If using WAL archiving, consider disabling it during the restore.
       To do that, turn off <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_mode</TT
> before loading the
       dump script, and afterwards turn it back on
       and take a fresh base backup.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Consider whether the whole dump should be restored as a single
       transaction.  To do that, pass the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-1</TT

       <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--single-transaction</TT
> command-line option to
       <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_restore</SPAN
>. When using this
       mode, even the smallest of errors will rollback the entire restore,
       possibly discarding many hours of processing.  Depending on how
       interrelated the data is, that might seem preferable to manual cleanup,
       or not.  <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT

       transaction and have WAL archiving turned off.

    So when loading a data-only dump, it is up to you to drop and recreate
    indexes and foreign keys if you wish to use those techniques.
    It's still useful to increase <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</TT
>
    while loading the data, but don't bother increasing
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>maintenance_work_mem</TT
>; rather, you'd do that while
    manually recreating indexes and foreign keys afterwards.
    And don't forget to <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> when you're done; see
