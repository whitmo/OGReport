 Installation
==============



Basic Use
=========

The package is designed to be a self contained build for the backend web application.

To get started, clone OGReporter and run the bootstrap::

$ git clone git://github.com/whitmo/OGReport.git ogreport
$ cd ogreport
$ python2.6 bootstrap.py


This will create the virtualenv that will act as your development
environment. If you wish to use this system with virtualenvwrapper,
see instructions below. If you are not using virtualenvwrapper, you
must activate the environment to access the installed scripts and
sandboxed python that will be doing the building.

$ . bin/activate  # aka source bin/activate

The full set of paver commands that compose the build are available
now. These can come in handy if you need to re-run just part of the
build.  You can also add your own commands in pavement.py. Take a
look::

$ paver help

To build PostGIS::

$ paver install_postgis




The Build
=========

One the primary reusable pieces of OGReport is the build for PostGIS,
Postgres, GEOS and friends and a basic environment for working with
PostGIS and python.

The build uses the 'eventlet' networking library to speed up
downloads and do some basic checking for connections with reasonable
timeouts.


Errata / Debugging
==================

* Incompletely unpacked packages

  If the building of a c package fails with an error about a missing
  file, erase it and it's tarball from the src directory and re-run
  the build.

  If the problem persists, you can retrigger the download, unpacking
  and building of a package by erasing references to it in the
  following places::

  ./build
  ./build_state.ini
  ./src


Using w/ virtualenv wrapper
===========================

The excellent virtualenvwrapper from Doug Hellman allows for a nice
way to work and manage your development, python or otherwhise.

To fully use OGReport with virtualenvwrapper (and benefit from any
postactivate or hooks), you will need to add a couple steps to the
normal build and setup.

$ git clone git://github.com/whitmo/OGReport.git $WORKON_HOME/ogreport
$ cd $WORKON_HOME/ogreport
$ python2.6 bootstrap.py
$ mkvirtualenv --python=python2.6 ogreport
$ workon ogreport
